AllGoTrading
============


This project provides FIX connectivity to the AllGoTrading website. So far it is a skeleton implementation for a full API. Active development effort by the users is required for further development of the API and their own trading strategies. 

A suite of unit tests is waiting for implementation of their respective classes. It is provided to show possible directions for further development. There exists a compensation scheme for participants of AllGoTrading intended to give incentive to push this project further. Details are posted on the AllGoTrading website.
