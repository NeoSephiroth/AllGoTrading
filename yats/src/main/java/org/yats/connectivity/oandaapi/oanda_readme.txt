If you do not plan to send orders to Oanda exclude "oandaapi" recursively from compilation
(Settings->Compiler->Excludes in IntelliJ IDEA)

To use the Oanda connection to send orders you need to
- apply for an account with Oanda
- obtain the Oanda_fxtrade Java library
- include it in the library path
- duplicate the configuration template file and add your Oanda user/password
